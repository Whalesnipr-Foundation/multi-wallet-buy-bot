# Solana Multi-Wallet Tracker

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Solana Wallet Tracker**, one of the fastest and most accurate tools for tracking top traders on **Solana / Pump.fun**. This bot enables you to **gain an edge in the market** by following successful wallets that consistently make profitable trades.

By analyzing wallet activity and detecting patterns in trading strategies, this tracker helps automate key trading decisions. In our private group, we use this exact method to **identify 50x plays weekly**.

## How It Works
### **Real-Time Blockchain Data Streaming**
To track wallets effectively, the bot requires **real-time data streaming** from the Solana blockchain. This is achieved using **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)**, which is:

âœ… **Fast & Low Latency** â€“ Faster than REST APIs, ensuring up-to-the-second data.

âœ… **Efficient & Scalable** â€“ Uses Protocol Buffers instead of JSON, reducing data size and improving performance.

âœ… **Supports Streaming** â€“ Live price feeds, mempool monitoring, and event tracking.

âœ… **Multi-Language Support** â€“ Works with Python, Go, JavaScript, Rust, and more.
